/**
 * Backend-neutral distributed communication C API.
 *
 * Provides primitives for multi-rank communication: init, create
 * subcommunicators, allocate shared windows, query local window base, query
 * window size, derive domain contexts, barrier, and destroy.
 *
 * Implementations:
 *   onboard/host/comm_hccl.cpp — HCCL backend (links CANN hccl/hccl_fwk)
 *   sim/host/comm_sim.cpp      — malloc-based simulation
 *   cuda/onboard/host          — descriptor-backed mock lifecycle and NCCL
 *                                setup plus baseline operations
 *
 * All functions are compiled into libhost_runtime.so. The linker selects
 * the implementation at build time, with no runtime dispatch or virtual
 * functions.

 *
 * Unlike comm_alloc_windows() which allocates the single base pool once at
 * bootstrap, this allocates an additional pool for a dynamically-derived
 * domain (a subset of the base communicator).  Multiple concurrent
 * allocations are disambiguated by `allocation_id`, which is mixed into
 * every internal handshake / barrier filename so a second allocation
 * does not collide with the first.
 *
 * This is a collective operation across the subset only: every
 * participating chip must call this with matching arguments; non-members
 * of the subset do NOT call it.  Internal file barriers synchronise the
 * subset, so the parent (orchestrator) only needs to dispatch and wait
 * for completion — it does not need to broker the cross-rank handshake.
 *
 * On HCCL this performs aclrtMalloc + the same Path-D IPC pattern as
 * comm_alloc_windows but on a fresh per-allocation buffer.  On sim it
 * shm_opens a fresh POSIX shm scoped by `allocation_id`.

 * Resources allocated here remain owned by the base handle; either an
 * explicit comm_release_domain_windows() or final comm_destroy(base)
 * frees them.

 * @param domain_rank             This caller's dense rank in the subset.
 * @param window_size             Bytes per rank.  Backend must allocate
 *                                exactly this size; no auto-rounding.
 * @param device_ctx_out          Receives a device pointer to a new
 *                                CommContext for the subset.

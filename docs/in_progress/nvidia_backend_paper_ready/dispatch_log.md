# NVIDIA Backend Paper-Ready Dispatch Log

This log records dispatcher-worker activity for the standalone pto-cu NVIDIA
backend goal. It is required review evidence; do not rely on private terminal
scrollback or unstated session memory.

## Logging Schema

Each entry must include:

- timestamp;
- dispatcher session or PR;
- worker id and objective;
- exact Codex command or script invocation;
- parent goal and child slice;
- branch name and PR URL or planned PR slot;
- allowed scope and files;
- dependencies and blocked assumptions;
- verification commands and results;
- merge decision and merge commit, when applicable;
- handoff summary and remaining gaps.

## Entries

### 2026-05-31 - Goal Activation And Standalone Scope

- Dispatcher session or PR: local Codex session on
  `goal/nvidia-paper-ready`; planned PR targets `uv-xiao/pto-cu:main`.
- Worker id and objective: no worker dispatched; dispatcher-owned preparation.
- Exact Codex command or script invocation: not applicable because no worker
  was launched in this entry.
- Parent goal and child slice:
  `docs/in_progress/nvidia_backend_paper_ready.md`, preparation slice.
- Branch name and PR URL: `goal/nvidia-paper-ready`; PR pending.
- Allowed scope and files: `docs/in_progress/`,
  `docs/nvidia-backend/changelog/`, `.agents/checks/`,
  `tests/ut/py/test_nvidia_review_artifacts.py`, and local `tmp/` notes.
- Dependencies and blocked assumptions: user clarified that this is a
  standalone project; upstream repositories must not be modified.
- Verification commands and results: initial focused test was intentionally red
  before adding goal artifacts:
  `PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1 PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python
  .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ut/py/test_nvidia_review_artifacts.py -q`
  failed because the ultimate-goal docs and changelog did not exist.
- Merge decision and merge commit: pending.
- Handoff summary and remaining gaps: next dispatcher should finish this
  preparation PR, then dispatch child slices for viewer data expansion,
  evidence guard hardening, CUDA runtime maturity, examples, remote evaluation,
  and paper-ready baseline reproduction.

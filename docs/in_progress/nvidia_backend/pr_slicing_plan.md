# Restart PR Slicing Plan

This plan tracks the current PR-sized route for continuing the NVIDIA backend
restart. The dirty orphan workspace is historical input only; new work starts
from `main` and lands through focused GitHub PRs.

## Current Baseline

- Base branch: `main`.
- Current accepted `main`: `f73620c6`, after PR #143
  (`Record UCCL EP fused boundary status`).
- Repository hygiene PRs have already moved agent guidance to `.agents/`,
  added interval-based Codex goal monitoring, and merged the latest
  FlashAttention append coverage slice.
- PR #143 added an explicit `--with-uccl-ep-fused-boundary` status gate. It
  records `status: unsupported` after the UCCL-EP handoff passes because
  `persistent_device_uccl_ep_runtime_fusion` is missing. It is not fused
  cross-GPU expert-parallel MoE evidence.
- The current audit branch `nvidia-goal-status-post-fused-boundary` owns only
  `docs/in_progress/nvidia_backend/goal_status_rollup.md`, this slicing note,
  the dispatch log update, and an optional review-artifact guard.

## Rules

- Each PR must stage only its owned paths. It must not bundle unrelated dirty
  worktree state.
- Use a fresh branch from current `main` for every child slice.
- Keep `docs/in_progress/nvidia_backend/dispatch_log.md` current for every
  branch, verification command, PR, merge decision, and handoff.
- Use interval-based monitor summaries before opening full tmux or transcript
  captures.
- Do not promote `docs/in_progress/` into `docs/nvidia-backend/` until the
  corresponding PR has been reviewed and accepted.

## Completed Bootstrap Slices

- PR #137: Codex goal monitor recurring tick support.
  - Result: merged as `7ab6dad31a6641c160305299a72467c74689486a`.
- PR #138: consolidate agent guidance under `.agents`.
  - Result: merged as `9e793ab1f51ccf2ffbf5120005acc2cddf42b843`.
- PR #136: broader Gluon FlashAttention append sweep coverage.
  - Result: merged as `c3964aad9204d0fbd0042ebbd7f88309530b80d2`.
- PR #139: restart tracking restoration.
  - Result: merged as `3722ad7efd7257fcc3807111aa449bfb49c57ea3`.
- PR #142: NVIDIA backend goal status rollup.
  - Result: merged as `afe82fb78783f24f36c01f41d9086064832cfaee`.
- PR #143: UCCL-EP fused boundary status.
  - Result: merged as `f73620c613b7a97c352384d6e90f32ae8c4106cd`.
  - Result type: structured unsupported boundary, not fused execution
    evidence.

## Restored Tracking Surface

The restored tracking surface now includes a concise umbrella goal,
source/skill notes, artifact audit, slicing plan, and dispatch log so future
workers have durable context without committing a scrollback-sized historical
log.

PR: <https://github.com/uv-xiao/pto-cu/pull/139>.

Restored paths:

- `docs/in_progress/001-nvidia-backend.md`
- `docs/in_progress/nvidia_backend/source_manifest.md`
- `docs/in_progress/nvidia_backend/skill_selection.md`
- `docs/in_progress/nvidia_backend/cuda_eval_script_selection.md`
- `docs/in_progress/nvidia_backend/current_cuda_artifact_audit.md`
- `docs/in_progress/nvidia_backend/pr_slicing_plan.md`
- `docs/in_progress/nvidia_backend/dispatch_log.md`

Verification gate:

```bash
git diff --check
```

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python .agents/checks/check_nvidia_review_ready.py
```

```bash
PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1 PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ut/py/test_nvidia_review_artifacts.py -q
```

Non-claims:

- This PR does not implement new CUDA runtime behavior.
- This PR does not run new H200 kernels.
- This PR does not prove new serving or DeepSeek output behavior.

## Current Status Rollup

The current acceptance-area audit lives in
`docs/in_progress/nvidia_backend/goal_status_rollup.md`. It separates
DeepSeek/vLLM serving evidence from simpler-nv kernel integration evidence and
selects exactly one next worker slice. After PR #143, the UCCL-EP fused
boundary worker is complete as an unsupported-boundary status slice; it is no
longer a next candidate.

## Next Slice

Choose this child slice after the status refresh PR is reviewed:

- Branch: `nvidia-uccl-ep-runtime-fusion-design`.
- Scope: dependency/design PR for `persistent_device_uccl_ep_runtime_fusion`.
- Objective: define the missing persistent-device graph to UCCL-EP runtime
  fusion contract exposed by PR #143, including payload ownership,
  rank/device mapping, status fields, failure modes, and review evidence
  required before an implementation PR can claim actual fused cross-GPU
  expert-parallel MoE execution.
- Non-claims: not DeepSeek serving, not vLLM plugin integration, not RDMA or
  multi-node evidence, not throughput or latency evidence, and not actual
  fused cross-GPU expert-parallel MoE execution.

Serving promotion and in-progress doc retirement remain deferred until this
communication dependency boundary is reviewable or the dispatcher explicitly
chooses a different branch from current `main`.
